Hello! Thanks for letting me work on this assessment. I really enjoyed it.

# How the app looks:

The first page you will see will look like this. You will be notified on the screen that there are no pages created.

You can add a new page through both buttons on the screen. 
You can add forms of any type from the modal above. 
I created a component for each page because they could be potentially very different, but if it was for production I would make sure to decide whether we want several pages components or one flexible page component.

This kind of menu will pop up for every page you create. All menu items work, some of them just have the alert() function. I explained it in my submission.

You can drag and drop pages and add new items by hovering over the dashed line between the buttons. To drag and drop drag a button and drop it on another button.

I hope you find this implementation clear and useful. I am looking forward to speaking with you and happy to discuss what I did here and why I did it this way.

Best,
Olga
